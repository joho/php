A the end of 2023 I shut down Hecate, my old startup making tools on top of GitHub to support engineering leaders stay abreast of their teams' work.

I've migrated the most interesting blog posts here under the main blog.

I also had a lot of fun writing the fortnightly newsletter, so I've preservered those in a [dedicated newsletter section](/hecate-newsletters)
