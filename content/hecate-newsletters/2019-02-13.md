Sorry for the later than usual email this fortnight.

A quick reminder that [Heartbeat Beta](https://hecate.co/blog/heartbeat-beta-launch) is live now and you can jump on board. Heartbeat's the cornerstone of a larger system of pull request analytics, giving you the right quantitative and qualitative measures to coach your dev team to even greater success!

## Tech

[Buildkite - Public build pages for open source](https://buildkite.com/changelog/46-public-build-pages-for-open-source)<br>
Big congratulations to the Buildkite team for getting this feature out. Their hybrid cloud/self-hosted CI is the ducks nuts and the ability to use it for open source projects is a huge win.

[Don't Let the Internet Dupe you, Event Sourcing is Hard](https://chriskiehl.com/article/event-sourcing-is-hard)<br>
Did you rush to implement event sourcing at your work after seeing a charismatic architect talk about it on stage? Did you ever get a hint of buyers remorse? No, me either.

[CCPA will hit your dev team harder than GDPR. Here’s why.](https://tonic.ai/post/ccpa-will-hit-your-dev-team-harder-than-gdpr)<br>
If you've just passed the hump on your big GDPR project at work get ready to go again!

[Statistics Done Wrong](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/)<br>
My favourite way to learn things is to look at them done wrong or broken and then learn the right way from there. If that's your jam, this book might be a good way for you to learn statistics.

[8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/)<br>
As a human with a smaller human at home and a startup on the go I have zero business looking at new hobbies. On the other hand, how fun would it be to design a fantasy console in the style of my youth?

## Business & Management

[Lessons From Keith Rabois Essay 1: How to become a Venture Capitalist](http://delian.io/lessons-2)<br>
Ignore "how to become a VC", this is just plain good hiring advice.

[Top 10 Learnings from the Redpoint Free Trial Survey](https://tomtunguz.com/top-10-learnings-from-the-redpoint-free-trial-survey/)<br>
I apologise for including a usage of the word learnings. There is some valuable information in that post about how to most effectively run free trials for your SAAS business.

[Eternal Market Patience Offers Eternal Rewards](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/eternal-market-patience-offers-eternal-rewards)<br>
Very interesting long term empirical study of which trading strategies consistently work. Long but worthwhile.

[Innovation Isn’t All Fun and Games — Creativity Needs Discipline](https://hbr.org/2019/01/the-hard-truth-about-innovative-cultures)<br>
I very much support this article's balanced look at what it takes to run an innovative culture. I have already had my lifetime dosage of TED talks about embracing failure and the secret truth about trust falls or whatever.

[jlevy/og-equity-compensation: Stock options, RSUs, taxes](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation)<br>
A big GitHub readme with everything you've ever wanted to know about employee share ownership. Totally US centric but worth reading for a couple of reasons: a lot of the ideas are roughly translatable, and worth understanding the dynamic at play in the dominant market for tech talent.

## Culture

[I tried John McAfee's signature 2020 cocktail and I will never be the same](https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/I-tried-John-McAfee-s-signature-cocktail-and-I-13575445.php)<br>
I don't know if I'm allowed to vote for the Pulitzer prize, but this is stand out content, within journalism as a whole and the niche subcategory of John McAfee content.

[Technique Thursdays](https://guide.michelin.com/sg/TechniqueThursdays/tag)<br>
I love this subcategory of Singapore's Michelin guide's blog. Weekly posts on really specific cooking techniques.

[The Secrets of Lyndon Johnson’s Archives, by Robert A. Caro](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-secrets-of-lyndon-johnsons-archives?src=longreads)<br>
A long but very worthwhile piece on the nitty gritty work that goes into being a historian.

[A Demystifying Decade for Economics](http://jwmason.org/slackwire/in-jacobin-a-demystifying-decade-for-economics/)<br>
A really interesting look at what's happening within academic economics in the decade since the stinkin old GFC.

[How an Olympic Hopeful Robbed 26 Banks on His Bike](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/February-2019/Bicycle-Bank-Robber-Tom-Justice/)<br>
The moral of this story is that even if you are really clever in parlaying your track cycling abilities into a great bank robbery technique, you'll still get undone by crack.

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[10 of the most epic science fictional dolphins](https://io9.gizmodo.com/10-of-the-most-epic-science-fictional-dolphins-5813477)<br>
Dolphins are from the sea and therefore facts about them are nautical. Even the hypothetical dolphins. Q.E.D.
