OK, friends, real talk now. The nautical fact free-ride has come to an end. It's time for you to endure the mandatory marketing pitch for my new startup.

One day Hecate will be a whole suite of tools to help all kinds of humans stay in the loop on rapidly changing code. Today I want to share what the first tool in that suite will be: a Github app to share merge notifications with non-technical stakeholders such as your product managers or your customer support team. If that sounds useful to you please [enrol in the private beta](https://goo.gl/forms/NZ72NtZiELXjU7E83).

With that out of the way, please enjoy this fortnight's links dump.
