Ahoy there readers! 

I've just returned from my trip to San Francisco with [Startmate](https://startmate.com.au/). Met a lot of interesting people and had a lot of good conversations about Hecate. I'm really, really excited to start putting the fruit of those conversations into the product.

Sydneysiders: I'll be running a mini-booth for Hecate at [Web Directions Summit](https://www.webdirections.org/wds/) November 1-2. Come say hi and grab a sticker.


## Tech

[ORM: We Approve](https://blog.remix.com/orm-we-approve-60f2a68f73fb)<br>
I really like this approach of "approval testing" for the SQL your ORM spits out. Seems like a good tradeoff of ease of dev cycle and protection against unexpected database surprises. Will definitely look into implementing it myself.

[A Great Old-Timey Game-Programming Hack](http://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-12-14-great-old-timey-game-programming-hack.html)<br>
Fun little story of all the wacky assembly hacks that go into making a ye olde video game fast. Kids these days have no idea. Get off my lawn.

[Jepsen: MongoDB 3.6.4](https://jepsen.io/analyses/mongodb-3-6-4)<br>
I love reading Jespen posts on how they test distributed databases for their failure modes. This is one of those. Maybe you will love it too.

[Microsoft’s problem isn’t how often it updates Windows—it’s how it develops it](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/microsofts-problem-isnt-shipping-windows-updates-its-developing-them/)<br>
In depth look at the problems in Microsoft's dev and planning processes and how they're hindering the company. I would not want to be in charge of trying to turn that particular ship.

[Exploring the Human Implications of Conway’s Law](http://enemygatedown.com/post/179189043313/exploring-the-human-implications-of-conways-law)<br>
Really interesting second order take on what Conway's Law can mean for how you manage your team. Strong recommend.

## Business & Management

[Capturing resources.](https://lethain.com/capturing-resources/)<br>
Short post on how dysfunctional resource allocation in companies to get and how to try and avoid falling into that trap yourself.

[Weatherproofing your startup for any financial climate](https://thedrawingboard.me/2018/10/17/weatherproofing-your-startup-for-any-financial-climate%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8athe-3rd-way/)<br>
A handy list of practical business things to do with your startup so it's ready to handle bad financial times. Assuming that's a thing you think might come up some time soon. Hashtag trade war.

[Roadmap to a SaaS IPO: unicorning your way to $100M revenue](https://medium.com/@StephNass/roadmap-to-a-saas-ipo-unicorning-your-way-to-100m-revenue-33e065ce7548)<br>
I can't say unicorning my way to anything is on my roadmap, but if it's on yours this is a pretty good guide to the pace you need to hit.

[Building Apps for Shopify: Fall In Love With The Problem](https://www.starterstory.com/blog/building-apps-for-shopify-fall-in-love-with-the-problem-not-the-solution)<br>
I was less interested in the theme of this post and more on the details. It amazes me how much money floats around in the Shopify ecosystem.

## Culture

[Jeff Bridges, John Goodman And Steve Buscemi Talk ‘The Big Lebowski’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=KNzquU4hjpk)<br>
The Big Lebowski is probably my all time favourite movie so of course I'm gonna post some interview with the three main stars.

[What duelling can teach us about taking offence](https://aeon.co/essays/what-duelling-can-teach-us-about-taking-offence)<br>
Super interesting take on how duelling historically worked and how it can give a new wrinkle on what it means when someone gives or takes offence.

[The New American Songbook: The oldies of the future.](https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/the-new-american-songbook-the-oldies-of-the-future.html?curator=MusicREDEF)<br>
Some guesses on what current songs we'll be hearing on GoldFM in the future. Someone stick this in a time capsule so we can verify later.

[Master of his universe: the warnings in JRR Tolkien’s novels](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2018/08/master-his-universe-warnings-jrr-tolkien-s-novels)<br>
Thinkpieces I didn't expect to read in 2018: the former Archbishop of Canterbury declaring Lord of the Rings anti-fascist.

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[World's oldest intact shipwreck discovered in Black Sea](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/23/oldest-intact-shipwreck-thought-to-be-ancient-greek-discovered-at-bottom-of-black-sea)<br>
Thanks to Jon Rowe for sending this one over. They've found a 2,400 year old ship at the bottom of the black sea. I'm looking forward to learning more about it as more data gets published.
