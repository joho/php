Ahoy there loyal readers. Apologies for the delay in this edition of the Hecate Fortnightly, but yesterday was ANZAC day and I was busy binge-watching The West Wing as a kind of MAGA palate cleanser. Enjoy the links and see you again in a fortnight. As always, feedback is very welcome, just reply to this email!
