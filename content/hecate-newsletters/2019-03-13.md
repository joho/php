I've got a fresh blog post for you this week that came out of a conversation I had with a recently promoted CTO: [AMA: What books do you recommend for the new CTO?](https://hecate.co/blog/books-for-the-new-cto). I'd love to hear if you've got any other recommendations you'd put on that list.

## Tech

[Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go](https://songlh.github.io/paper/go-study.pdf)<br>
Empirical research on the kinds of concurrency bugs Go programmers write. I found it particularly interesting to learn that channels make it more, not less, likely that you'll get something wrong in concurrent code.

[DSHR's Blog: It Isn't Just Cryptocurrency Mining](https://blog.dshr.org/2019/03/it-isnt-just-cryptocurrency-mining.html)<br>
Interesting analysis of the energy use of all the different kinds of computing going on in the world. Spoiler: it's a lot and it's growing fast.

[Cloud Irregular: IAM Is The Real Cloud Lock-In](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2019/02/18/cloud-irregular-iam-is-the-real-cloud-lock-in/)<br>
I had not really thought about IAM in the same way as Active Directory: a massive complexity trap and vector for lock-in. Oh well. Nothing to do about it now I guess.

[Using Custom React Hooks to Simplify Forms](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/using-custom-react-hooks-simplify-forms/)<br>
This is a nice and clear tutorial on how to rewrite forms to use the new React Hooks.

[Formally Specifying UIs](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/formally-specifying-uis/)<br>
This post shows how you can easily (well, more easily than I expected) specify UI transitions in a way that can help you resolve navigation bugs. If your app has some complex navigation or other kinds of state machines this could be really helpful to you.

## Business & Management

[15 lessons from our first $15 million](https://nathanbarry.com/15-lessons-15-million/)<br>
Great to see details about a small team making a big impact. Useful read for the boot/fundstrapper types in the audience.

[Kung Fu](https://blog.asmartbear.com/kung-fu.html)<br>
Kung Fu is a long collection of various thoughts on doing startups and I agree with quite a lot of them. Worth spending some time working through them.

[How to run an efficient and effective All Hands meeting](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-run-an-efficient-and-effective-all-hands-meeting-dc0808c4c8b1)<br>
Mathilde shares the template her company uses for all hands meetings. Looks useful for founders of growing teams. Love the way they re-introduce old hires if there are no new hires to introduce.

[Ikea: Price first, design later](https://www.businessinsider.com/ikea-price-first-design-later-2016-10?IR=T)<br>
[It's price before product, period](https://firstround.com/review/its-price-before-product-period/)<br>
A couple of strong examples on why you should work backwards from the price you want to charge when designing any product.

[How to evolve an engineering organization.](https://lethain.com/how-to-evolve-eng-org/)<br>
This is a bit of a Will Larson meta post, tying together a bunch of past posts into a helpful framework for evolving engineering teams over time.

## Culture

[Mo’ Moral, Mo’ Panic: the very predictable reaction to Momo](https://overland.org.au/2019/03/mo-moral-mo-panic-the-very-predictable-reactions-to-momo/)<br>
My favourite part of this article is taking the quotes from various past media panics and redacting what the actual thing parents are worried about. I got 0% of them right.

[Data-driven solutions to the notorious 304 bus route](https://www.bamacgabhann.ie/2019/02/304-data-driven-solutions/)<br>
I applaud the author's dedication to solving their own tedious daily bus trip.

[What happened to broadband in Australia?: NBN Co’s former CEO on how the Coalition broke the internet](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2019/march/1551445200/michael-quigley/what-happened-broadband-australia)<br>
This essay made me sad about Australia but happy that I live in a suburb that got the NBN _before_ the change in government.

[Do You Believe in Sharing?](http://timharford.com/2013/08/do-you-believe-in-sharing/)<br>
History of the idea of "the tragedy of the commons". Turns out, the guy behind it is a bit of a garbage human and that he got the idea wrong. Zero for two.

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[Best Submarine Nonfiction Books](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/4264.Best_Submarine_Nonfiction_Books)<br>
Who doesn't need a list of amazing true stories about submarines in their life? Not me.
