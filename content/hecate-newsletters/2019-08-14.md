Happy Wednesday friends. Not much in this issue for the finance nerds but some good tech and culture links.

## Tech

[3 Kinds of Good Tech Debt](https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2019/three-kinds-of-good-tech-debt)<br>
A practical and pragmatic take on "things you think are bad but are actually OK". I'm especially fond of hardcoding all the things.

[Scaling Static Analyses at Facebook](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238344-scaling-static-analyses-at-facebook/fulltext)<br>
Interesting to see hard data on how to successfully integrate static analysis into a development workflow. Timing is everything.

[Ten Unexpected Uses for LINC Preview Links](https://linc.sh/blog/ten-unexpected-uses-for-preview-links?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hecate-newsletter)<br>
If you're doing any kind of modern JS app build I highly recommend you check out LINC for their infinite staging build environment stuff. Very cool and I use it almost every day.

[The Right Way to Ship Software](https://firstround.com/review/the-right-way-to-ship-software/)<br>
Spoiler: there is no right way. Great read on the various process knobs you can turn and the contexts in which you might want to turn some of them.

[Why React Hooks?](https://tylermcginnis.com/why-react-hooks/)<br>
This has been my favourite overview of React hooks and explains all the expected benefits you should get using them rather than just saying "they're the future, use them".

## Business & Management

No business links this issue. I didn't read anything that particularly impressed me over the past couple of weeks.

## Culture

['Dad Builds' Are Making Lazy Gaming OK, And I Love That](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/08/dad-builds-are-making-lazy-gaming-ok-and-i-love-that/)<br>
I'm extremely here for this phenomenon. Being a dad and a founder has put a lot of gaming out of my reach and anything that can bring it back in makes me happy.

[Charles And Ray Eames Made Life Better By Design](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/02/738083070/charles-and-ray-eames-made-life-better-by-design-their-home-was-no-exception)<br>
A great look at one of my favourite pieces of home architecture. I love the way they used the constraints of cheap commercial components to still make something very expressive and homey.

[The Flawed Reasoning Behind the Replication Crisis](http://nautil.us/issue/74/networks/the-flawed-reasoning-behind-the-replication-crisis)<br>
An interesting essay suggesting that science would be in better shape today if everyone used Bayesian probability in experimental design ahead of straight up frequentist inference. I'm not 100% on board but it's a pretty reasonable argument.

[On the Evolution of Fatness in Society](https://lithub.com/on-the-evolution-of-fatness-in-society/)<br>
My interest in "fatness as social construct" articles seems to increase more and more as I slide into middle age. I wonder why?

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[The Pirate Who Penned the First English-Language Guacamole Recipe](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/first-food-writer)<br>
William Dampier did many bad things in his life, but he did bring Guac to the rest of the world so I guess on balance he was OK?
