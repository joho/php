Ahoy there!

Not much preamble this fortnight, I'm head down, bum up working on features for the next [Heartbeat](https://hecate.co/produces/heartbeat) release. Here are some things I read that hopefully you will too.

## Tech

[Michael Chan - Hot Garbage Architecture, Clean Code is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NP_upexPFg)<br>
My favourite tech talk I've watched for quite a while and well worth your time. Don't 100% agree with clean code being dead, but think his position is a better starting point than the "teach all the robots how to be pedants" that seems to hold sway in the industry today.

[Transmuting Low-Value Programmer Cred into High-Value Status lllegibility](https://daedtech.com/transmuting-low-value-programmer-cred-into-high-value-status-lllegibility/)<br>
An interesting insight into the realpolitik behind the technical track and why people never hire "staff engineers".

[From Prototype to Production: Lessons from Building and Scaling Reddit's Ad Serving Platform with Go](https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/gophercon-2018-from-prototype-to-production-lessons-from-building-and/)<br>
It's got pictures of boxes with lines between them and numbers and everything else you need in a tech architecture rundown.

[Undersea Internet cables are at risk](https://www.iafrikan.com/2018/09/07/rising-seas-are-threatening-undersea-internet-cables/)<br>
This was a borderline nautical fact for the issue because my love of deep sea cabling is well documented, but figured it's more straight tech than nautical. TL;DR lots of internet cables that need to be dry will probably be wet soon. Really wet.

[Floppy Disk Archiving – Legacy Mode](https://blog.legacymode.com/2018/09/09/floppy-disk-archiving/)<br>
Shoutout to the old Geelong airquote "hacking" crew! Fun, borderline excessively technical post about backing up ye olde floppy disk formats from old mate Segra.

[Risky Business Requires Active Operators](https://codahale.com/risky-business-requires-active-operators/)<br>
If you've got one of those magical CI pipelines that deploy everything without you having to do anything, have a read of this and think really hard about whether that's such a shit hot idea.

[My Five Worst Bugs: Lessons Learned In System Design](https://adamtornhill.com/articles/worstbugs/lessonssystemdesign.html)<br>
Lists of mistakes made and lessons learned are my favourite way to learn.

## Business & Management

[Navigating branding for tech startups—a founder's journey](https://99designs.com.au/blog/logo-branding/branding-for-tech-startups/)<br>
Another newsletter, another shameless self-plug. Shared the story of how all the Hecate branding came together with my old team to make a blog.

[We Spent $3.3M Buying Out Investors: Why and How We Did It](https://open.buffer.com/buying-out-investors/)<br>
Buffer bought out their VCs and told everyone all about it. I would love to read the other side of the story.

[Why we backed Amber Electric – Black Sheep Capital](https://medium.com/black-sheep-capital/why-we-backed-amber-electric-79e06aab03f8)<br>
I sit next to Chris at the Startmate office and this is all about his company. If you're in Sydney and want cheaper electricity go have a look.

[Investor-Founder fit in day-zero startups](https://medium.com/@pt/investor-founder-fit-in-day-zero-startups-de28530043ac)<br>
This is the question that's ruling my life right now.

## Culture

[The Political Life is no Life at All](https://meanjin.com.au/essays/political-life/)<br>
A great essay on the toxicity of being in the political class and how that keeps regular humans out of the structures of power.

[Generative Art Finds Its Prodigy](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/generative-art-finds-its-prodigy)<br>
Generative Art is rad and you should learn more about it and maybe even do it. This is a good inspiration point to start from.

[Why Nietzsche has once again become an inspiration to the far-right](https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/08/why-nietzsche-has-once-again-become-inspiration-far-right)<br>
I can't keep up with whether or not I'm allowed to like Nietzsche. It's a tough game being a fair weather undergraduate level philosophy fan.

[This SimCity-Like Tool Lets Urban Planners See The Potential Impact Of Their Ideas](https://www.fastcompany.com/40548501/this-simcity-like-tool-lets-urban-planners-see-the-potential-impact-of-their-ideas)<br>
[An Urban Planner Plays Sim City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUQaCoxybW8)<br>
Did I spend a half hour of my life watching a town planner narrate his own game of sim city? The chance you asked yourself that question is inversely proportional to the length of time you've been a subscriber to this here newsletter.

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[Conservation couple buys New Zealand Navy warship](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-11/newcastle-couple-buy-a-warship/9992160?smid=Page:%20ABC%20News-Facebook_Organic&WT.tsrc=Facebook_Organic&sf197404437=1)<br>
Thanks Aprill for sending over this one. I now have a new lifegoal of buying an ex-warship from the NZ navy. Which is a thing you can do.
