How do these fortnights roll around so fast?

## Tech

[Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club/)<br>
Classic essay/talk and a must read. Love the innovation token approach. My favourite reformulation of it is "one miracle per project". Trigger warning for all engineering managers.

[Mistaeks I Hav Made: Mistakes we made adopting event sourcing (and how we recovered)](http://natpryce.com/articles/000819.html)<br>
See above. Seriously though, valuable lessons both in specifically adopting event sourcing, and in the risks from splitting the difference in architectural approaches.

[Technical Debt: Poor System Understanding While Time Constrained](https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/technical-debt-poor-system-understanding-while-time-constrained-66385d110498)<br>
This is a really interesting alternative mental model of what technical debt is.

[A Rails middleware to change the log level at runtime](https://nebulab.it/blog/rails-middleware-change-log-level/)<br>
One of those super niche small quality of life tips that really adds up over time.

[How Does Spotify Know You So Well?](https://medium.com/s/story/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe)<br>
Deep dive into all the kinds of machine learning Spotify use to generate your playlists. I actually learned things about ML from this because I care about music than whether something is a hotdog or not.

## Business & Management

[Development Cadence](https://medium.com/@msquinn/development-cadence-bf98b0e56906)<br>
Minimum viable product/project management to get your team shipping product on a more regular cadence. Really useful for startups hitting that handful of engineers and first slowdown.

[How I Survived Insane Hypergrowth at Airbnb](https://www.nea.com/blog/how-i-survived-insane-hypergrowth-at-airbnb)<br>
Some really useful career advice wrapped in a personal story of working at Airbnb through the rough and tumble growth years.

[Startup idea checklist](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html)<br>
Great checklist for a quick sanity check before kicking off a startup. Some of them are a little too "dent in the universe" for my taste but overall pretty good.

[Key B2B SaaS Lessons from SaaStr Europa 2019](https://blog.usejournal.com/key-b2b-saas-lessons-from-saastr-europa-2019-c808d91129d5)<br>
Lots of useful information in a well written summary of this years SaaStr conference. Even more time efficient than watching the talks at 3x speed for all you lifehacking sociopaths.

[Why Founders Clash With The Investors on Their Boards](https://medium.com/startup-grind/why-founders-clash-with-the-investors-on-their-boards-8d2d1f121ad1?_hsenc=p2ANqtz--OVofLPoHerXJ2-3i8mWfSj8ynt1llOAeJF0CC7wsSeZCXUU8Niibe-pLVRrBYazU_k1nzftrjj7vqTpaylZPqS8vmJA&_hsmi=73885634)<br>
While this post is aimed mostly at investors with board seats, it's got some good general pointers on delivering feedback and worth a look for anyone.

## Culture

[Top chefs share insanely good instant noodle hacks](https://amp.delicious.com.au/food-files/how-to/article/top-chefs-share-insanely-good-instant-noodle-hacks/j4n6ozub)<br>
For all the talk of startups getting to "ramen profitable" too much of it is about the profit and not enough about the ramen.

[The Wonders of Industrial-Supply Catalogs](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/07/15/power-tools/)<br>
My Dad's a mechanic and there were many of these kind of catalogs present in my childhood. Strong feels for this one. Your mileage may vary.

[Playlist: The Drones Rage Guest Programmers](https://a1000mistakes.wordpress.com/2016/06/05/play-list-the-drones-rage-guest-programmers/)<br>
All the Aussies of a certain age will understand the cultural significance of a rage guest programming slot, but for the rest of you [wikipedia will sort you out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(TV_program)#Guest_programmers). This playlist has been on heavy rotation this week.

[How William Gibson’s lost Alien 3 script became 2019’s strongest audio drama](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/6/24/18700951/william-gibson-alien-3-script-audio-drama-michael-biehn-hicks-ripley-lance-henriksen)<br>
I know I'm in a minority as a person who enjoyed Aliens 3 but I'm now really looking forward to getting stuck into this alternative take from one of my favourite authors.

[The Middle Eastern Thirty Years War?](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-middle-eastern-thirty-years-war.html)<br>
It's been said that history doesn't repeat itself but it does rhyme, as evidenced in this essay comparing current middle east conflict with the thirty years war in Europe.

## Contractually Obligated Nautical Fact

[When Pepsi Had a Navy](https://lflank.wordpress.com/2019/06/25/when-pepsi-had-a-navy/)<br>
Pretty amazing story of how Pepsi were the temporary custodians of a portion of the Soviet navy. I don't actually fact check these nautical facts by the way. Huge if true, fun if not.
