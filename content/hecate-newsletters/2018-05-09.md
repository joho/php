Apologies for a shorter and uncategorised newsletter this fortnight. I'm on holidays in NZ right now showing off a fresh-ish baby to the extended family.

In keeping with the trip, this fortnight's Nautical Fact I've lifted wholesale from the Maritime New Zealand website. In 1769 ship’s boy Nicholas Young receives a gallon of rum and has Young Nick’s Head named after him for being the first on board the Endeavour to spot land (in NZ).

[Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design](http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html)<br>

[A reading list for new engineering managers](https://jacobian.org/writing/engmanager-reading-list/)<br>
A good reading list for new tech leaders to work their way through. I've read most on the list and recommend them, so I trust the rest of the list is good too.

Interesting time management tactics for fans of the pomodoro technique.

[The Great Theorem Prover Showdown](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/theorem-prover-showdown/)<br>
Great read - a novel approach to tackling the "obviously true" axiom of FP being easy to reason about and some interesting insight into the FP community.

Save yourself some time and effort next time you need a project dashboard and throw this up on the office TV.

Nice library/reference implementation for using JWT auth tokens in a SPA calling a rails app.
